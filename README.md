# elastic-search-heuristics
Search Index enabled programs

The motordelears project implements the use of multiple elastic clusters at the same time.
However, this connections are constructed lazily when requested for the first time.


The bookmemoiz program implements the use of a single elastic cluster.

### Requirements

The project requirements are specified in the ```requirements.txt```

You can run your elastic search inside a container as per the following commands:

    ```docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.3.0
docker run -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.3.0```

NOTE: The project implements Elastic search version 8 but the provided above requires no authentication as suitabele for testing.

Elasticsearch documents are defined in a ```search_indexes``` app.

The basic units of information in the project are expressed in a ubiquitous internet data interchange format(JavaScript Object Notation). This units are indexed or assigned to a type inside an index.

In the ```bookmemoiz``` project all the respective models(Author, Publisher, Tag, Book) have been flatterned into a single ```BookDocument``` which holds all the required information.

All environments should have different indexes i.e for testing, staging and prodcution environments.

Access to the documents location should be done through a pythonic file path.

The projects use the default shards and replica provisions.
